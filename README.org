* Ready Player Mode

An Emacs major mode to open media (audio/video) files like any other file (via find-file, dired, etc).

Previewing videos is also supported.

Optionally, there are additional features like indexing and searching.

* Install / Setup

This package is available on MELPA.

If you just want Emacs to recognize and open media files (find-file, dired, etc.), this is all you need:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (use-package ready-player
    :ensure t
    :config
    (ready-player-mode +1))
#+end_src

To customize supported media files, set =ready-player-supported-media= before toggling =ready-player-mode=.

* Remember my music collection

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (setq ready-player-my-media-collection-location "path/to/my/media/collection")
#+end_src

From then onwards, you can directly open your collection via =M-x ready-player= (unless you were last playing something else). If you want to explicitly open your media collection, invoke =M-x ready-player-open-my-media-collection=.

* Ready player buffer key bindings

* Toggle recognition

You can optionally toggle media recognition on and off interactively via =M-x ready-player-mode=.

* External dependencies

** Playback

=ready-player-mode= relies on command line utilities to play media.

By default, =ready-player-mode= will try to use either =mpv=, =vlc=, =ffplay=, or =mplayer= (in that order). Customize =ready-player-open-playback-commands= to your preference.

Install either of these using your favorite method.

On macOS:

#+begin_src sh
  brew install mpv
#+end_src

** Metadata

Metadata is extracted using =ffprobe=, which comes bundled with [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kaIXkImCAM][ffmpeg]].

Install using your favorite method.

On macOS:

#+begin_src sh
  brew install ffmpeg
#+end_src

** Thumbnails

=ready-player-mode= prefers [[https://github.com/dirkvdb/ffmpegthumbnailer][ffmpegthumbnailer]] to generate thumbnails, but will fallback to =ffmpeg= otherwise.

Install using your favorite method.

On macOS:

#+begin_src sh
  brew install ffmpegthumbnailer
#+end_src

* Customizations

** Video vs audio

If you'd like to use different utilities to play video and audio, you can use =ready-player-open-playback-commands= for this with something like:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (setq ready-player-open-playback-commands
        '((ready-player-is-audio-p "mpg123")
          (ready-player-is-video-p "mpv")))
#+end_src

** Play all videos as audio

Ready player avoids auto-advancing video files to prevent awkward switching between video window and Emacs.

If you'd like to play all video files as audio (no video stream playback) and auto-advance via repeat, use the following settings:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  ;; Recognize video files as audio.
  (setq ready-player-supported-audio (append ready-player-supported-audio
                                             ready-player-supported-video))
  ;; Don't recognize any file as video.
  (setq ready-player-supported-video nil)

  ;; Disable video stream playback (mpv player)
  (setq ready-player-open-playback-commands
        '(("mpv" "--audio-display=no" "--video=no" "--input-ipc-server=<<socket>>")))
#+end_src

** Buttons (macOS SF Symbols)

If you have [[https://lmno.lol/alvaro/emacs-insert-and-render-sf-symbols][SF symbol rendering in Emacs]] on macOS, you can use enable usage in buttons by invoking =(ready-player-macos-use-sf-symbols)=
 prior to =(ready-player-mode +1)=:

 #+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
   (ready-player-macos-use-sf-symbols)
   (ready-player-mode +1)
 #+end_src

** Buttons (Linux)

Default icons are =◁◁ ▶ ■ ▷▷ ➦ ⇆=. These can be customized (see all icon variables). I'm happy to take suggestions for improving default icons.

* Tips and Tricks
** Centering the Buffer with Olivetti Mode

If you prefer to center the buffer content, especially when working
with large screens, you can use =olivetti-mode= to achieve
this. =olivetti-mode= is a lightweight Emacs package that centers text
in the buffer, making it more readable and visually appealing.

Note that =olivetti-mode= does not perform "true centering" (i.e.,
centering each line individually). Instead, it centers the entire
buffer content by adding padding to the left and right, effectively
creating a centered column of text. This approach ensures consistent
alignment and avoids visual distractions caused by uneven line
lengths.

To enable centering for =ready-player=, add the following configuration
to your Emacs setup:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package olivetti
  :defer t
  :ensure t
  :init
  (defun my-center-ready-player-on ()
    "Enable olivetti-mode and visual-line-mode for ready-player."
    (setq olivetti-body-width 0) ; Or a number to control the amount of chars to be centered
    (olivetti-mode 1)            ; Enable olivetti-mode
    (visual-line-mode 1))        ; Enable/Disable visual-line-mode for text wrapping of your liking

  ;; Hook into ready-player's major mode
  (add-hook 'ready-player-major-mode-hook #'my-center-ready-player-on))
#+END_SRC

This configuration will automatically center the buffer content
whenever =ready-player= is active. You can adjust the
=olivetti-body-width= value to control the width of the centered text.

*** Note:

Although =olivetti-mode= handles edge cases well and is a robust solution
for centering text, if you prefer not to use =olivetti-mode=, there are
alternatives like =perfect-margin=, =centered-window-mode=, or =darkroom=,
which you can configure similarly.
