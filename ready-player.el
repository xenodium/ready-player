;; `ready-player-mode' is a lightweight media (audio/video) major mode for Emacs.
;;
;; Setup:
;;
;;   (require 'ready-player)
;;   (ready-player-mode)
;;
;; To customize supported media files, set `ready-player-supported-media'
;; before invoking `ready-player-add-to-auto-mode-alist'.
;;
;; `ready-player-mode' relies on command line utilities to play media.
;;  Customize `ready-player-open-playback-commands' to your preference.

Each command entry is a list to cater for additional command flags.

Omit file path parameter, as it will be automatically appended.

Prepend each command with a function to apply additional logic.

For example, to use different utilities for video and audio:

  ((ready-player-is-audio-p \"ffplay\" \"--audio-display=no\")
   (ready-player-is-video-p \"mpv\"))

You can further extend with additional logic like:

  ((ready-player-is-ogg123-p \"ogg123\")
   (ready-player-is-audio-p \"ffplay\" \"--audio-display=no\")
   (ready-player-is-video-p \"mpv\"))

To cater for different extensions, use a list of extensions as
first item in command list:

  (((\"mp3\" \"ogg\") \"audacious\")
   (\"mpv\" \"--audio-display=no\")
   (\"vlc\")
   (\"ffplay\")
   (\"mplayer\"))

To inject a socket file, use <<socket>>:

   ((\"mpv\" \"--audio-display=no\" \"--input-ipc-server=<<socket>>\")
    (\"vlc\")
    (\"ffplay\")
    (\"mplayer\"))

Note: Socket can only be used by mpv player. Get in touch if keen to
add for other players."
